\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

There is a variety of theoretical~\cite{PhysRevB.12.125,PhysRevA.103.L061303,2112.09232} and experimental~\cite{PhysRevLett.106.105301,feld2011observation,PhysRevLett.120.060402,PhysRevLett.124.240403,2106.11893} work on two-dimensional gasses.

\Ref{PhysRevA.86.013626} gives a detailed account of what the contact means in 2D, and in fact in Table III even gives what we have concluded is the operator definition of the contact.

We should crush everyone.
