\section{Observables}\label{sec:observables}

The contact is given by~\cite{PhysRevA.86.013626}
\begin{align}
	\hat{C} &= \frac{2 \pi M}{\hbar^2} \frac{dH}{d\log a}
	&
	\hat{C}\Delta x^2 &= 2\pi \frac{d\tilde{H}}{d\log a} 
	\label{eq:contact}
\end{align}
\Refs{Froehlich2011,PhysRevLett.109.130403} report a measurement of the contact.
Specifically they measure $C/k_F^2$ as a function of $1/\log k_F a_{2D}$ in the Fermi liquid regime.
In \Ref{PhysRevLett.109.130403} Fig. 4 they show a comparison with a zero-temperature fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculation~\cite{PhysRevLett.106.110403}; the theory and experiment agree at $1/\log k_F a \gtrsim 0.5$ but the experiment and the theory diverge deeper into the weak-coupling regime $1/\ln k_F a \sim 0.3$.
The disagreement is only one data point, so who knows; the experimentalists did a ladder approximation and reproduced that one point.
I can't make heads or tails of the method; \Ref{doi:10.1063/1.443766} claims the solution is exact in the region bounded by the nodes.
