====================================================

Ref. :cite:`bertaina2013` provides some contact data.

Figure 2 provides the normalized, mean-field subtracted energy normalized directly but as a function of their :math:`g=-1/2 \log(k_F b)` (just after (2)) where :math:`b` sets the binding energy as :math:`-1/mb^2` (just below Figure 1).
Therefore, :math:`b` is the scattering length in our convention.  However, :math:`g=\alpha/2`.
