=====================================================

Ref. :cite:`PhysRevLett.116.045303` measured a population-balanced mixture of :math:`N \sim 100000` :math:`{}^6`\ Li atoms tuned via Feshbach resonance.

Figure 3 gives measurements of the equation of state, reporting :math:`n/n_0` for different :math:`\beta \epsilon_B` and :math:`\beta \mu`.

The data were provided by Philipp Lunt.
